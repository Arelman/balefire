### Overview
**IODA** is an operational prototype system that monitors the Internet in near-real-time, aiming to detect large-scale Internet outages that affect the edge of the networkâ€”such as Autonomous Systems (ASNs) or significant portions of a country. It is a powerful tool for identifying and analyzing network disruptions caused by technical failures, natural disasters, or government-imposed censorship.
